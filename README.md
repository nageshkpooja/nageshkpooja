Hey there! 👋  

I’m Pooja Krishnappa Nagesh, a data & analytics engineer based in the USA.

I design and build data systems that turn raw, messy data into reliable, analytics-ready datasets.

If data is slow, inconsistent, or hard to trust, chances are I’ll model it, validate it, and make it production-ready.

My main tech stack includes Python, SQL, Spark, Airflow, AWS, and Snowflake.  
I focus on ETL pipelines, data modeling, performance optimization, and data quality to support analytics and ML workloads.

I’ve worked on end-to-end data platforms from ingestion and transformation to dashboards and AI-driven applications.

I’ve pinned a few projects below that showcase:
