Hey there! 👋  

I’m Pooja Krishnappa Nagesh, a data & analytics engineer based in the USA.

I turn raw, messy data into trusted, analytics-ready datasets using advanced SQL, Python (pandas), and dimensional data modeling.

If data is slow, inconsistent, or hard to trust, chances are I’ll model it, validate it, and make it production-ready.

My work focuses on ETL pipelines, data quality validation, KPI reporting, and performance optimization, supporting analytics and experimentation across platforms like Snowflake, Redshift, Spark, Tableau, and Power BI.

I’ve pinned a few projects below that showcase:
